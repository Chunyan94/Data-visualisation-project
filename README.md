# project - demographic and economic data visualization and analysis 

This project, inspired by renowned statistician Hans Rosling, examines the change in fertility rates from 1990 to 2020 and explores variations in rates among countries based on the UN Human Development Index (HDI).

Source data

1.  *United Nations Demographic Indicators*: This data contains
    information on fertility rate changes for countries from 1950 to
    2100. 
2.  *United Nations Human Development Index (HDI)*: This composite index
    measures average achievement in three dimensions of human
    development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent
    standard of living.
3.  *Gross national income (GNI) per capita* : The GNI per capita is the
    dollar value of a country's final income in a year, divided by its
    population. It should be reflecting the average before tax income of
    a country's citizens.
