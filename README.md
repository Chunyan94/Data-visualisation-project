# project - demographic and economic data visualization and analysis 

Analyzed global fertility rates from 1990 to 2020 using Python and R, focusing on variations linked to the UN Human Development Index. Key aspects of this project included:

•	Statistical Analysis: Applied regression analysis and time series forecasting to examine trends and assess correlations between fertility rates and HDI indicators.
•	Data Visualization: Created dynamic visualizations to present complex data, making demographic trends accessible and understandable.
•	Project Limitations: Identified countries needing elderly care services based on life expectancy and economic factors but recognized the model’s limitations in specifying optimal investment targets.
•	Future Model Development: Planned to enhance accuracy with machine learning techniques, aiming to refine investment recommendations for healthcare services.


Source data

1.  *United Nations Demographic Indicators*: This data contains
    information on fertility rate changes for countries from 1950 to
    2100. 
2.  *United Nations Human Development Index (HDI)*: This composite index
    measures average achievement in three dimensions of human
    development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent
    standard of living.
3.  *Gross national income (GNI) per capita* : The GNI per capita is the
    dollar value of a country's final income in a year, divided by its
    population. It should be reflecting the average before tax income of
    a country's citizens.
